Version: 1.0.0
  Features:
    - Added settings to allow for the configuration of the flow rate of each transformer.

    - Added ability to enable/disable the ability to use the shortcuts in most scenarios.
  Bugfix:
    - Fixed several crashes introduced in 0.1.18 despite the fact I swear I tested those scenarios

  Note:
    - Remove all transformers from grids upon updating.

Version: 0.1.18
  Optimizations:

    - This includes trains.
    - Leaving the setting as is since vehicles can have a significant performance hit and it really needs more stress testing. (Beta)
