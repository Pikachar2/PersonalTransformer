Version: 0.1.10
  Features:
    - Added 'Allow Personal Transformer in non-armor grids' setting for allowing placement of Personal Transformer in non-armor grids.
  Changes:
    - Removed ability for Personal Transformers to be placed inside of vehicle grids.
	- Code for vehicles is still here, but the ability to put the item in them is removed unless setting is checked.
	- Left here for people to play around with if they desire.
  Current Bugs:
    - Vehicles do not drain energy properly. Vehicles can power the network but no drain from batteries currently occurs.
    - Transformers do NOT work if you put them in after other equipment in vehicle grids. No idea why. 
    - Despite these bugs I've released this so that people could at least attempt to use the functionality. If you've got a fix, please let me know!
